We have made sure that our NFTs have distinctive characteristics with slight glimpse of characters loved among the people. We have so much planned for our community- DAO, digital real estate access, etc and for that we need a constructive community which support us and give life to our project. Our entire team- from community managers to developers, all are working very hard. We need an engaged community and we will do all possible to make this project a success as you know quality takes time. We want to expand this universe and for support we are relying on you! We want to thank all of our supporters. If you like DeFiHood, we have a lot of ideas for the roadmap as well as some delicious surprises.",
